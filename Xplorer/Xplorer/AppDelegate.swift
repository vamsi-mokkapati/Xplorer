/**
 The AppDelegate is responsible for all main operation of the app.  It is a Singleton instance that maintains state for the whole app.
 
 It extends UIResponder and implements UIApplicationDelegate.
 
 Note about properties:
 *  `window` is a UIWindow that specifies the window space of the application
 *  `locationManager` is necessary to start and stop the delivery of location-related events to the app
 *  `GMSMapServicesKey` is the Google Maps iOS API key for our project
 *  `GMSPlacesServicesKey` is the Google Places iOS API key for our project
 *  `GMSPlacesServicesKey_alternate` is an alternate Google Places iOS API key for our project (we were running up API quotas)
 *  `GMSPlacesWebServicesKey` is the Google Places Web API key for our project
 *  `GMSDirectionsKey` is the Google Directions Web API key for our project
